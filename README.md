# Fastai Template

This is some simple boilerplate to be able to work with the fast.ai library on google colaboratory.

## Getting Started

This should be everything you need to complete fast.ai course work on google colab.

### Prerequisites

- Google Colaboratory - https://colab.research.google.com
- Google Drive - https://drive.google.com
- Kaggle Credentials - https://www.kaggle.com

If you don't already have Kaggle API credentials, they can be created under under My Account > API > Create New API Token.

Keep kaggle.json credentials in a convenient place, because you will need the file everytime you begin a colab instance.

### Installing

Log in to the google account you want to use with Colaboratory and Drive. Drive serves as some static storage if needed.

1. Open the template in colab
2. Run the first code block to mount your google drive to the instance directory.
3. Run the second block to install the fastai library.
4. Upload your kaggle.json credentials with files.upload()
